## Hi, I’m Mateusz. I’m a data analyst with the curiosity and imagination to make connections between different data sets, draw conclusions and turn problems into solutions. In the past, I worked as a Truck driver where I could see from the inside how large logistics companies operate, thanks to which I will be able to look more closely at all processes taking place in logistics. Self-organization of work shouldn’t be a problem also. Now, I would like to apply my knowledge and skills to improve decision-making processes. I’m not only looking for a job that will broaden my horizons but also help me improve myself.
